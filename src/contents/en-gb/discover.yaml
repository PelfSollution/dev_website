intro:
 para1: The Authenticator is an important application that users need to create an account and get started on the SAFE Network.
 para2: The SAFE Browser is used to surf safe:// websites and web applications, while the authenticator is used for creating the user account and managing the application authorisations. Applications must be authorised by the user to be able to connect to the SAFE Network on behalf of the user. The user can revoke the granted access at any time from the authenticator.
 para3: Applications using the SAFE Network does not store its Users' data on any central server, rather the data is spread across many disks and devices owned and managed by many different users.
authenticator:
  title: Authenticator
  desc: The Authenticator, which enables users to securely authenticate themselves onto the SAFE Network, while protecting their network login credentials from apps. Bundled with the SAFE Browser and registers a custom URL scheme safe-auth://. Similarly every app registers their own safe--prefixed url-scheme.
  steps:
    - title: App Requesting Access
      desc: The application must authorise with the Authenticator with the needed access permissions. The application can create its own container, and request access to default containers or other applications' containers through the authorisation request.
    - title: User Granting Access
      desc: When the user approves the request, application specific encryption keys are generated. The application will be identified in the network using its keys. When the user grants or denies authorisation, the application will receive a URI.
    - title: Application Connecting To Network
      desc: Applications can connect to the SAFE Network on behalf of the user by using the URI received.
networks:
  title: Network Types
  desc: Applications can be developed on SAFE Network using one of the three network types depending on development stages.
  types:
    - name: Mock Routing
      id: mockRouting
      para1: When the SAFE Browser, or another application, is built with mock-routing enabled, it’s not connecting to a live network, it’s interfacing with a local database that is created on your system to simulate network operations.
      para2: This saves a great deal of time and provides a safe space for your application or website to initially test operations.
      btnLink:
        name: Know more
        link: '#'
    - name: Local Network
      id: localNetwork

vault:
  title: Vault
  desc: User uploads (or saves) a ﬁle to the network, via one of the SAFE Network apps, the file is automatically broken up into chunks. These chunks are then encrypted (encoded so that only authorised parties can read it), randomised and stored on the vaults of other SAFE Network users. These encrypted chunks are completely unreadable and inaccessible to anyone other than the owner.

    name: Develop
    link: '#'
containers:
  title: Default Containers
  desc: "The SAFE Network follows a similar pattern of providing default containers. Default containers can be shared by applications when the user grants the needed permission. The default containers are:"
  quote: The data stored in the containers must be encrypted, except for the _public container.
  list:
    - title: _documents
      desc: To store document related data
      icon: document
    - title: _downloads
      desc: To store downloaded content
      icon: download
    - title: _music
      desc: To store music files
      icon: music
    - title: _pictures
      desc: To store images
      icon: pictures
    - title: _videos
      desc: To store videos
      icon: videos
    - title: _public
      desc: To store unencrypted data
      icon: public
    - title: _publicNames
      desc: To store public name to looked up public information
      icon: pubNames
dataTypes:
  title: Data Types
  desc: The SAFE Network provides two data types to store and retrieve data. The amount of data that a user can store depends on their Safecoin balance. During test networks, the user account limits are regulated based on the number of mutation requests permitted for the account.
  types:
    - name: Mutable Data
      features:
        - title: About
          para: MutableData can be compared to a simple key-value store. MutableData allows fine-grained access control for collaboration. Permission to insert, update, delete, manage can be requested or permitted for collaboration.
