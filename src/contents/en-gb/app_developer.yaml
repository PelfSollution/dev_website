  para1: The SAFE Network is a scalable, distributed application platform, with baked-in security. It doesn’t rely on third party cloud services, and abstracts away security, encryption and user management to make building truly Decentralized Apps (D-Apps) less complex.
  para2: You are free to code and build your apps faster with zero infrastructure costs.

  para2: The Authenticator is used by applications to request a user’s consent via a simple API, much like traditional single sign-on options. The Authenticator also handles user log on, and enables the user to grant/revoke permissions for each app, putting users in control of their own data.
