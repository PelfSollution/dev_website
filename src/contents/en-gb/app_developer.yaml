  para2: You are free to code and build your apps faster with zero infrastructure costs.

    dark: Accessing
    light: the Network
  para1: To access the SAFE Network, you simply need to download the browser which includes the Authenticator component.
  para2: The Authenticator is used by applications to request a user’s consent via a simple API, much like traditional Single Sign-On options. The Authenticator also handles user log on, and allows the user to grant/revoke permissions for each app as they want, putting users in control of their own data.
  para3:
    chunk: The user’s data is stored in ‘containers’ on the network. If you want to read more on network data structure and storage
