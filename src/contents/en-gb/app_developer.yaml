  subTitle: Make D-Apps the easy way
  para1: The Safe Network is a scalable, distributed application platform, with baked-in security. It doesn’t rely on third party cloud services, and abstracts away security, encryption and user management to make building truly Decentralized Apps (D-Apps) a breeze.
  para2: You are free to code and build your apps faster with zero infrastructure costs.

    light: the future
  para: Desktop, Web, Mobile and IoT applications can be easily built on the SAFE Network. You can work with a number of languages to bring your ideas to the new, decentralised internet.

    - title: Saving Decentralised Data
      icon: contact-app
      para:
        chunk1: When using traditional NoSQL platforms like MondoDB, or Redis we'd need to implement both the database in our application as well set up a server to handle requests, or go direct to a cloud provider like Firebase. But these are centralized solutions that you as an app developer will be paying for.
        chunk2: With SAFE, you have no infrastructure to set up, and as the user own's their data, they commit it directly to the network. All you need worry about is your data structures and authorising your application against the network.
    - title: File storage
      icon: file-storage
      para:
        chunk1: Beyond using the network as a decentralized key-value storage, we can store much more that purely serialised data structures. Using the Network File System (NFS), you and your users can store any file, regardless of size or type, easily on the network.
        chunk2: What's more, securing your users data is a breeze and built right into the network.
        chunk3: You no longer need to worry about servers, CDNs, backup or data duplication. The SAFE Network handles all this for you. So you're free to create something useful for everyone.
    - title: Sharing Data Across Applications
      icon: share-data
      para:
        chunk1: Traditionally accessing another applications data would involve a maze of APIs and authentication systems. More third parties, more problems. And in the end you'd still be responsible for storing and securing that data too!
        chunk2: This is no longer an issue on SAFE. With user's owning their data, all you need do is request access to specific containers or Mutable Datas and you're off.
        chunk3: Complex inter-application data sharing has never been easier or more secure.

    dark: Accessing
    light: the Network
  para1: To access the SAFE Network, you simply need to download the browser [download image below] which includes the Authenticator component.
  para2: The Authenticator is used by applications to request a user’s consent via a simple API, much like traditional Single Sign-On options. The Authenticator also handles user log on, and allows the user to grant/revoke permissions for each app as they want, putting users in control of their own data.
  para3:
    chunk: The user’s data is stored in ‘containers’ on the network. If you want to read more on network data structure and storage
